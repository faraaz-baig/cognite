# Cognite: High-Performance ML Framework in Rust

Cognite is a high-performance machine learning framework implemented in Rust, designed to leverage GPU acceleration for optimal performance. This project is currently in its early stages of development.

## Features

- GPU-accelerated vector operations using OpenCL
- Efficient memory management with a custom memory pool
- Flexible tensor operations (work in progress)
- Designed for high performance and memory efficiency

## Current Status

This project is in active development. Current implemented features include:

- Basic tensor structure
- GPU-accelerated vector addition
- Memory pooling for efficient GPU memory management

Many more features are planned and under development.

## Installation

To use Cognite, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You also need OpenCL drivers installed for your GPU.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/faraaz-baig/cognite.git
   cd cognite
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Cognite for vector addition:

```rust
use cognite::tensor::Tensor;
use cognite::ops::add_vectors;

fn main() {
    let a = Tensor::new(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0], false);
    let b = Tensor::new(vec![4.0, 5.0, 6.0], false);
    
    let result = add_vectors(&a, &b);
    
    println!("Result: {:?}", result);
}
```

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

## Future Plans

- Implement more GPU-accelerated operations (multiplication, convolution, etc.)
- Add support for neural network layers
- Implement automatic differentiation
- Optimize performance further
- Add comprehensive documentation and examples
